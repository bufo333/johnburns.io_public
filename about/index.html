<p><strong>Green Technology and sustainable agriculture</strong> I am very active in the aquaponics community. This technology allows for the farming of fish as a protein source, while utilizing a porous stone or clay medium to grow vegetables. This allows bacteria to filter the waste of the fish, while generating Nitrogen fertilizer which the plant roots in readily absorb. This allows rapid food production with minimal footprint and efficient use of fish waste as a source of energy.</p>

<p><strong>Amateur Radio</strong> While not as popular as it once was amateur radio is still in the forefront of IOT networking, satellite communications, digital communications technologies. I have been licensed for over 20 years, my call sign is KG4OLW and I have communicated with people all over the world as well as volunteered and trained to help with emergency communications during natural disasters and other emergencies.</p>

<p><strong>Typewriters</strong> I love collecting and restoring old typewriters. I have a number of them and when I can find them I usually buy them and restore them. I don&rsquo;t keep most of them I just sell them on, but I feel proud to help restore some of these beautiful specimens before they can be trashed. We live in such as disposable culture these days it&rsquo;s nice to be able to touch a product made out of steel more than 100 years ago that is still functional and will last for generations to come.</p>

<p><strong>Writing</strong> I enjoy reading quite a bit and I have started by hand at novel writing. While most of those stories are just for me. Eventually I may end up publishing one if it meets my standards. for now the endeavor is a personal one. I like most writers feel the need to get the story out so it stops bouncing around in my head.</p>
