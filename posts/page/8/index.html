This feature takes advantage of the HAL independence of Vista and allows you to backup your entire system at one time using the magic of volume shadow copies to backup open files. The backup is also stored in a virtual machine file which means that you can boot, run, and extract files from your backup using Microsoft Virtual PC. This is a really neat feature! If the previous feature isn’t enough for you Microsoft will let you restore your pc by bootin</p></p></li>

<p>I have spent the last couple weeks breaking the Iphone in every way possible. I Now have it running as a mail server. One of the great things about the iphone is that it is running mac os x leopard, which is just version 9 of the darwin kernel. That means that once you get out of the ch-rooted environment on the phone, you can install the BSD subsystem. The BSD subsystem basically just adds back all the unix tools we have come to know and love. After that it is just a matter of compiling an embedded version of apache or your web server of choice. Next you can use NFS shares to mount more available storage. I will post some pictures here of some interesting screen shots. The arm cpu in the phone is actually quite fast. This of course is all just for iphun ( pun intended) however it is nice to have shell access on the phone. I do a lot of networking for a living and it is nice to have ssh and telnet on my phone. This makes it much easier to program routers and do many other things</p></p></li>

            MIT student arrested for fake bomb An MIT student was arrested in Logan intl Airport for wearing a sweatshirt with a prototyping board on it and a 9 volt battery which lit up some ledï¿½s that said MIT course VI which is the numerical designation for computer and electrical engineering majors. The shirt which she has and has been wearing for a long time, was something that a class of students made as a project.</p></li>

<p style="margin: 0in 0in 10pt" class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: 'Georgia','serif'">I am in the process of designing a 20m moxon antenna. I like the moxon so much I decided to make a quick moxon for 2m tonight. I built it out of twine and 2 dowel rods. I wanted to see how cheap I could build one, and the total cost of this antenna is $4.28. Not bad for an antenna on the cheap. The moxon is a great antenna and the reason why it is well liked on HF is because it exhibits the gain of a 2 element yagi antenna with the s/n rejection of a 3 element yagi! This antenna is easy to build and hand holding it you can tell which direction the local repeaters are. As you rotate the moxon away from the repeater, the signal disappears completely!</span></p></p></li>
