This got my interest peaked as I wondered if there were still BBS systems Alive and well on the internet. Information on BBS systems was few and far between in my research and it took …

                    Rotary Pools for Semi-Static NAT / Port range Forwarding Cisco routers have a very robust network address translation feature set.The NAT software allows you to control translation with access-list, route-maps, and destination pools.With the wide array of commands, it is sometimes difficult for beginners and experts to figure out how to combine …

Each type of connectivity offers advantages and disadvantages. Some of these tunnels can …
