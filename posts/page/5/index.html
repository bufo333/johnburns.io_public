            Replace a running config without reloading The new Cisco IOS 12.4 train has many new features that any engineer will find useful; one of the features that fix a pain point for me is the new config options available in 12.4. Have you ever been in a situation where an entered configuration does not work as expected? Now usually you have to back out the configuration one command at a time and hope for the best.</p></li>

            Working a lot! I have been working a lot lately, we are in the proccess of designing a new data center with all the ifs ands and buts included in that ordeal. I am in the proccess of writing several write ups. On spanning tree:
 &ldquo;load balancing spanning tree using different trunks&rdquo; BGP implementation and design considerations. IGP routing protocol deep dive.  </p></li>

            Encrypting GRE tunnels In our Last article we looked at creating GRE tunnels between networks to allow non routable traffic to pass between remote offices.� GRE tunnels are a great solution however the traffic passing inside these tunnels is not encrypted and thus could be intercepted by unauthorized parties. In this article we are going to look at tunneling GRE inside of IPSEC. This will allow us to get the benefits of GRE and the security of IPSEC.</p></li>

                <p></p><p>
            Create a GRE tunnel between endpoints Many time it is necessary to link a remote office to your main site and today we have many technologies to accomplish this task. We have IPSEC tunnels, IP-IN-IP tunnels, and GRE or Generic Routing Encapsulation Tunnels.
Each type of connectivity offers advantages and disadvantages. Some of these tunnels can even be overlaid on top of one another. For instance IPSEC can be used in a transport mode, which allows you to use the encryption with other tunnels or protocols.</p></li>

                <p></p><p>
            Cisco 3750 Switches now include a time domain reflectometer! How many time have�you wanted to know how long a cable run was? Now if you are running cisco 3750 switches you can find out by issuing the following commands you can see how long that cable run really is.
Switch# test cable-diagnostics tdr interface gigabitethernet0/2TDR test started on interface Gi0/2A TDR test can take a few seconds to run on an interface.</p></li>
