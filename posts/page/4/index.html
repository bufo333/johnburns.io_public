                    gopher I have been continuing to setup the bbs software on bbs.techinvasion.net. I have added irc, gopher, finger, and ident functionality. I encourage all of you to drop by and experience this neat software. The really neat thing about this BBS software is that it connects you to a world of forums and message boards that can only be accessed using BBS software. If you are running firefox I encourage you all to go to gopher://bbs.

                    Blast From the Past - BBS.Techinvasion.net Recently as a project cleaning up some old files and software, I came across a software disk for an old BBS I used to run. This got my interest peaked as I wondered if there were still BBS systems Alive and well on the internet. Information on BBS systems was few and far between in my research and it took me a while to make some headway.

                    Rotary Pools for Semi-Static NAT / Port range Forwarding Cisco routers have a very robust network address translation feature set.The NAT software allows you to control translation with access-list, route-maps, and destination pools.With the wide array of commands, it is sometimes difficult for beginners and experts to figure out how to combine these elements to solve a problem.
I have a small network at home for the computers in my house, and I find that some of the strangest configurations and explorations come about because I try to solve problems in a way that is cost affective with the limited broadband available to consumers.

                    Content Based Access Control &ldquo;CBAC&rdquo; In the beginning God created heaven and earth, and then he created routers, so packets could flow from one part of the earth to the other. As he rested he looked down on his creation and smiled for all was good. Packets were flowing from one interface to another. Then as he beheld his creation he watches as some pad packets decided to flow where they didn&rsquo;t belong!

                    Introduction to access-lists part 2 In the second installment of our guide to access-lists we are going to talk a little about named access-lists, how they work, what the benefits are, and how using them allows us to create reflexive access-lists. Named access-lists are exactly what they sound like, they are an extended access-list that has a name instead of a number. One of the nice features of named access-lists is that each line of the access-list has a number.
