<p>Recently as a project cleaning up some old files and software, I came across a software disk for an old BBS I used to run. This got my interest peaked as I wondered if there were still BBS systems Alive and well on the internet. Information on BBS systems was few and far between in my research and it took me a while to make some headway. Eventually I came across <a href="http://synchro.net/"><a href="http://Synchro.net">http://Synchro.net</a></a>� BBS software. This software is very similar to old school dos BBS&rsquo;s. I installed the software which was no small feet�given the inadequate build instructions. Once the system was built and installed I had allot of fun setting up classic door games such as Trade wars and others.</p>
<p>I also discovered that Dove-net and Fido-net are still alive and well, and there are a great many BBS�s connected all over the world. If the internet is a vast global city such as Coruscant (in Star Wars) then BBS�s and protocols such as telnet and gopher are its seedy underworld. An eclectic grouping of forgotten protocols running on forgotten systems, used by a hand full of lost souls who still cling to the web as it was. I had allot of fun setting up this BBS and I would like to use it in some way as a fun addition to part of my site.</p>
<p>In the spirit of the above and to old memories and a simpler if not better time I want to announce that <a href="telnet://bbs.techinvasion.net/">telnet://bbs.techinvasion.net</a> is open for business, with door games and all. Accounts are free, and I have even put up a forum for people to request firmware and various other things that they might need for a networking project. I hope everyone has as much fun using the system as I had creating it and I hope to see everyone in a session of Trade Wars.</p>
