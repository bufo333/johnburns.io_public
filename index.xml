      <description>Develop and Deploy Network Templates Before Automating Date: 2022-05-26
Subject: Network Templating
Version 1.0
Automation is the number one topic in networking today. Automation allows a team to lean left, moving simple troubleshooting to the NOC, it allows the team to do more with less, and it allows for repeatable deployments. A good place to start is to think about many of the day to day work that gets done, how much of this work is simply applying the same changes over and over.</description>

      <description>poem So live your life that the fear of death can never enter your heart.Trouble no one about their religionRespect others in their viewAnd demand that they respect yoursLove your life, perfect your life, beautify all things in your lifeSeek to make your life long and its purpose in the service of your peoplePrepare a noble death song for the day when you go over the great divideAlways give a word or a sign of salute when meeting or passing a friendEven a stranger when in a lonely placeShow respect to all people and grovel to noneWhen you arise in the morning give thanks for the food and for the joy of livingIf you see no reason for giving thanks, the fault lies only in yourselfAbuse no one and nothingFor abuse turns the wise ones to fools and robs the spirit of its visionWhen it comes your time to dieBe not like those whose hearts are filled with the fear of deathSo that when their time comesThey weep and pray for a little more timeTo live their lives over again in a different waySing your death songAnd die like a hero going home</description>

      <description>Slow Downloads in Itunes If you are experiencing slow downloads in iTunes try this:
Shut down iTunes
Disable antivirus/internet security suite
Open itunes and resume downloads.
This is most often caused by the internet security suite which is not capable of scanning large files in real time. If this fixes your problem, you can usually make the fix permanent by disabling the piece of the antivirus that filters web traffic.</description>

      <description>New route-server available! I have been working on a new project which is to provide a service that would allow you to peer with my router over BGP. My router would then advertise a list of bogons and known malicious networks including botnet command and control networks. You can then drop these networks at your border router thus protecting your network from attacks and saving precious router and firewall resources. Right now I am not offering the peering service but I do have a route-view server available that allows you to login and get a full list of the malicious ip networks for ipv6 and ipv4.</description>

      <description>MPLS VPN Services This article with aim to take a in depth look at MPLS and explain how your packets get from one side of the MPLS cloud to another. Hopefully this will give you some perspective that will prove useful in troubleshooting issues in your own MPLS implementations.
Most enterprise engineers MPLS experience goes something like this: The company needs to connect the office in Miami and the office in London with the corporate headquarters office in Chicago.</description>

      <description>SSH Brute Force Mitigation in Junos I have several Juniper SRX-210 devices configured in remote offices. One of the biggest problems I have is that there are a lot of people that are constantly running scripts against the ssh daemon. Now I could lock it down to only a specified list of allowed IP addresses. This would be the most secure method but i have a business requirement of being able to connect to this device from many different location.</description>

      <description>Public DMVPN network. I was thinking about a new project idea. I was thinking of setting up a dynamic multipoint VPN concentrator. Put a small LAN behind it with a couple of servers. Put the configuration instructions on a webpage for Juniper and Cisco devices. I was thinking to run BGP routing protocol over the interface as it scales reasonably well.
The important part here is I wanted to create a web form which requests the internal and external address ranges of anyones network.</description>

      <description>Using IP SLA with Route-maps I recently came across a problem that is not an uncommon problem that small businesses face. I came up with several solutions to their problems and I thought I would take a minute to discuss one of those solutions. This customer has a business requirement to use a proxy server for all outgoing web traffic. This on the face of it seems like a simple problem, there are many good proxy vendors out their such as my favorite vendor Blue Coat.</description>

      <description>Introduction to Filter list for JUNOS Junipers JUNOS is a very robust operating system, not only is the OS very advanced but the ASIC heavy design of Juniper hardware is akin to calorie free chocolate bars! Juniper Filter Lists which are non-stateful packet filters similar to Cisco Access-Lists are compiled and processed using hardware, what this means is that you can have as many Filter-Lists as you want and as long as you want without degrading performance.</description>

      <description>gopher I have been continuing to setup the bbs software on bbs.techinvasion.net. I have added irc, gopher, finger, and ident functionality. I encourage all of you to drop by and experience this neat software. The really neat thing about this BBS software is that it connects you to a world of forums and message boards that can only be accessed using BBS software. If you are running firefox I encourage you all to go to gopher://bbs.</description>

      <description>Rotary Pools for Semi-Static NAT / Port range Forwarding Cisco routers have a very robust network address translation feature set.The NAT software allows you to control translation with access-list, route-maps, and destination pools.With the wide array of commands, it is sometimes difficult for beginners and experts to figure out how to combine these elements to solve a problem.
I have a small network at home for the computers in my house, and I find that some of the strangest configurations and explorations come about because I try to solve problems in a way that is cost affective with the limited broadband available to consumers.</description>

      <description>Content Based Access Control &amp;ldquo;CBAC&amp;rdquo; In the beginning God created heaven and earth, and then he created routers, so packets could flow from one part of the earth to the other. As he rested he looked down on his creation and smiled for all was good. Packets were flowing from one interface to another. Then as he beheld his creation he watches as some pad packets decided to flow where they didn&amp;rsquo;t belong!</description>

      <description>Introduction to access-lists part 2 In the second installment of our guide to access-lists we are going to talk a little about named access-lists, how they work, what the benefits are, and how using them allows us to create reflexive access-lists. Named access-lists are exactly what they sound like, they are an extended access-list that has a name instead of a number. One of the nice features of named access-lists is that each line of the access-list has a number.</description>

      <description>Introduction to access-lists part 1 Today I would like to take some time and talk about security. I want to discuss access-lists, extended access-lists, reflexive access-lists, and CBAC or content based access control. Learning how to properly use access-lists is so crucial to becoming a good network administrator. They are vital to securing your network and as you progress with your studies you will find that access-lists are used quite extensively in routing, QoS, and other important things.</description>

Have you ever been in a situation where an entered configuration does not work as expected? Now usually you have to back out the configuration one command at a time and hope for the best.</description>

      <description>Encrypting GRE tunnels In our Last article we looked at creating GRE tunnels between networks to allow non routable traffic to pass between remote offices.� GRE tunnels are a great solution however the traffic passing inside these tunnels is not encrypted and thus could be intercepted by unauthorized parties. In this article we are going to look at tunneling GRE inside of IPSEC. This will allow us to get the benefits of GRE and the security of IPSEC.</description>

      <description>Create a GRE tunnel between endpoints Many time it is necessary to link a remote office to your main site and today we have many technologies to accomplish this task. We have IPSEC tunnels, IP-IN-IP tunnels, and GRE or Generic Routing Encapsulation Tunnels.
Each type of connectivity offers advantages and disadvantages. Some of these tunnels can even be overlaid on top of one another. For instance IPSEC can be used in a transport mode, which allows you to use the encryption with other tunnels or protocols.</description>

Now I thought this would be an easy job, configure the Juniper to connect to our checkpoint r55 box the same as the pix had done before!</description>

      <description>Cisco 3640 and wic-1adsl speed problems I recently decided to plug my wic-1adsl card into a 3640 router because my 2620 had a power supply failure. I noticed that the cisco 3640 ran very slow, and speed tests topped out at 2.6mbps downlink speeds. For a while I couldn&amp;rsquo;t figure out why a router that is faster with more memory would run slower than my 2620 router. I later discovered the reason for the slowness was because of a bandwidth limit on the nm-1fe1r2w card I was using to give me wic slots.</description>

      <description>Outlook 2003 error setting up profile after uninstalling office 2007 This is a problem that I run into quite alot as most new PCs come with the Office 2007 trial pre-installed. When you try to setup Outlook 2003 for the first time you get the following error
&amp;ldquo;There was an error locating one of the items needed to complete this operation. It might have been deleted&amp;rdquo;
In order to fix this error you have to rename &amp;lsquo;mapisvc.</description>

      <description>Fixing the SKU01A.CAB and other office cab file issues Anyone who has used office 2003 has noticed that when switching domains or logging in as a new user Microsoft Office ask you to insert the cd to cache files needed to start. In some cases it asks for files from older office versions that have been upgraded, sometimes you don&amp;rsquo;t even have the original cd. To solve this problem you can make a simple change to the registry that tells office not to expect cached files off the installation cd.</description>

      <description>An overview of CISCO IOS Security features as related to packet filtering. �The Cisco IOS has many powerful security features that enable network engineers to protect their internal network. The Cisco IOS is capable of intrusion detection, deep packet inspection, and stateful firewall features. Setting up IPS allows the admin to push intrusion detection to the network edge. The Cisco IPS feature set can scan for spyware, viruses, worms, Trojans, and network intrusions by receiving updated signature files from Cisco.</description>

      <description>Configuring WIC-1ADSL on Cisco 2600 with PPPOA and PPPOE Configuring a Cisco router to use the WIC-1ADSL card is one of the most commonly asked question by people in the Cisco forums. There are some interesting and compelling reasons to use a WIC card instead of connecting PPPOE through the ADSL modem in bridged mode. One of the most compelling reasons is the ability to use advanced QOS features such as interleaving and fragmentation.</description>

      <description>Vista Complete-PC backup to network share The real magic of the new Vista backup tool is the second option Complete-PC backup. This feature takes advantage of the HAL independence of Vista and allows you to backup your entire system at one time using the magic of volume shadow copies to backup open files. The backup is also stored in a virtual machine file which means that you can boot, run, and extract files from your backup using Microsoft Virtual PC.</description>

One of the great things about the iphone is that it is running mac os x leopard, which is just version 9 of the darwin kernel. That means that once you get out of the ch-rooted environment on the phone, you can install the BSD subsystem.</description>

      <description>2 m Moxon project. I�am in the process of designing a 20m moxon antenna. I like the moxon so much I decided to make a quick moxon for 2m tonight. I built it out of twine and 2 dowel rods. I wanted to see how cheap I could build one, and the total cost of this antenna is $4.28. Not bad for an antenna on the cheap. The moxon is a great antenna and the reason why it is well liked on�HF is because it exhibits the gain of a 2 element yagi antenna with the s/n rejection of a 3 element yagi!</description>

      <description>Open Solaris 10 sandbox Thanks to those friendly people from Digg.com who decided it would be fun to bring my Solaris box to its knees by forking and other things to DDOS my Solaris zone. I have learned many ways of enhancing the security of Solaris zones. I have limited the Sandbox zone to 1% of total CPU usage. I have limited the total number of processes to 1000 and I have installed the Solaris Jass security hardening script.</description>

      <description>First Production ZFS server today I have plenty of small business clients and sooner or later they all face one big challenge. They all outgrow the initial 80GB tape drives that we put on their servers. The problem is that most of these are small businesses and most of them could just afford the initial network, and asking them to pony up $2000+ for a new tape drive or worse yet autoloader is out of the question.</description>

      <description>TV Networks Just Don&amp;rsquo;t Get it I t seems to me that the big four tv network either don&amp;rsquo;t understand what people want or simply don&amp;rsquo;t care. If you look at the cable networks you have stimulating things to watch like Nip Tuck, Dexter, Sleeper Cell, Battlestar Galactica, Monk, and too many other good dramas to mention. However when you turn to the major networks they simply show one copied worn out reality show after another.</description>

      <description>Things I Wish I Knew About Solaris When I First Started. Solaris 10 is a very powerful scalable operating system that feels tightly integrated and highly responsive. However for those of us with a strong Linux or FreeBSD background Solaris can feel a little unfamiliar and even downright confusing. This post is made up of a few things I wish I knew before I started my Solaris 10 adventure. I hope it will make things a little easier for those of you wanting to take the plunge into a true enterprise operating system.</description>

      <description>IP Filter and FreeBSD IPF is a very robust firewall included in FreeBSD by default. This is a statefull firewall with logging capabilities that can also be used to NAT a local network in situations where the FreeBSD box is the router. The best way to get IPF working is to compile the kernel with support built in. Although the default kernel has support through the use of loadable modules, compiling the options into the kernel provide a more flexible and robust system.</description>

      <description>Solaris Zones Part 1 So what is a zone?
A zone is analogous to a VMware machine but with some distinct advantages as well as some disadvantages. To start explaining zones lets start by comparing it to VMware since most people are familiar with VMware. VMware is a software program that runs on a host operating system,. This could be Windows, Linux, or a custom kernel in the VMware ESX series.</description>

I will go through them and pick the best ones to include here.

      <description>Laptop crashes when power source is changed fix Like most people who have complained about this problem I had recently upgraded to mandrake 9.2 and was surprised by the lack of problems usually associated with upgrading distro&amp;rsquo;s. My surprise turned to horror when I realized the my laptop a Dell Inspiron 8000 would freeze as soon as I unplugged the a/c adapter or plugged in the a/c adapter.
After searching for days for the fix and listening to contradictory advice I had finally sorted out the good from the bad information and concluded that a kernel recompile was necessary.</description>
